# DROIDS-1.0
DROIDS (Detecting Outlier Impacts in molecular Dynamic Simulation) is a GUI-based pipeline that works with AMBER16, Chimera 1.11 and CPPTRAJ to analyze and visualize comparative protein dynamics on GPU accelerated Linux graphics workstations.  DROIDS employs statistical methods for detecting significant changes in molecular dynamics simulated on two homologous PDB structures.  Quantitative differences in atom fluctuation and atom correlation (i.e. vector trajectories) are displayed graphically and mapped onto movie images of the protein dynamics.  P values indicating significant changes are also able to be similarly mapped.  DROIDS is useful for examining how mutations or binding interactions affect protein dynamics.
